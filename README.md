### Text2SQL:

**A Langgraph workflows that converts your question to sql query isntantly.**

### Overview:

Text2SQL lets you query your data using natural language questions instead of writing SQL by hand.

You provide your data as CSV files → the system automatically loads them into a SQLite database → then you can ask questions like:

- "How many customers are from Victoria?"
- "What are the top 5 products by revenue in 2024?"
- "Show average order value per customer segment"

The system generates a safe SQL SELECT query, validates it, adds a LIMIT clause for safety, executes it, and displays the results in a clean table — all through a simple Streamlit interface.
